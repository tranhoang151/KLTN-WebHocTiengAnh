## Usage

### For Parents

1. Navigate to the Parent Dashboard
2. Click on "Progress" to access the progress interface
3. Select a child from the available tabs
4. Use the tab navigation to explore different aspects:
   - **Overview**: General progress and insights
   - **Learning Streaks**: Daily activity calendar
   - **Badges & Achievements**: Earned badges and goals
   - **Progress Reports**: Detailed weekly/monthly analysis

### For Developers

```typescript
import { ParentProgressInterface } from '../components/progress';

// Use in parent dashboard routing
<Route path="/progress" element={<ParentProgressInterface />} />
```

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation addresses the following requirements:

- **R01.6**: Parents can view child's progress using student credentials
- **R05.3**: Parents log in with student credentials to show child's learning statistics
- **R05.5**: Learning streaks are displayed with streak calendars and statistics
- **R06**: Badge system with visual collection and achievement tracking
- **R10**: Child-friendly interface with responsive design
- **R12**: Performance optimization with loading states and error handling

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

- Lazy loading of child data
- Efficient state management
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo where appropriate
- Progressive data loading

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Loading states for better UX

### Accessibility

- Screen reader support
- Keyboard navigation
- High contrast support
- Semantic HTML structure

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live progress updates
2. **Export Functionality**: PDF report generation for offline viewing
3. **Notification System**: Email/SMS alerts for milestones and achievements
4. **Comparison Views**: Progress comparison between siblings or class averages
5. **Goal Setting**: Parent-child collaborative goal setting interface

## Testing

Basic test coverage is provided in `__tests__/ParentProgressInterface.test.tsx`. The tests cover:

- Component rendering
- Loading states
- Tab navigation
- Error handling
- User interactions

To run tests:

```bash
npm test -- ParentProgressInterface
```

## Dependencies

- React 18+
- React Router for navigation
- Chart.js for performance charts (via existing PerformanceChart component)
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- TypeScript for type safety
