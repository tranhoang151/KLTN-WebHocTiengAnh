# HTTPS Setup Guide

## âœ… Setup Complete!

Your React application is now configured to run with HTTPS using mkcert.

## What was configured:

### 1. mkcert Installation
- âœ… mkcert is installed and working
- âœ… Local CA is installed in system trust store

### 2. SSL Certificates
- âœ… `certs/localhost.pem` (certificate)
- âœ… `certs/localhost-key.pem` (private key)
- âœ… Valid for localhost, 127.0.0.1, and ::1

### 3. Package.json Configuration
- âœ… `cross-env` installed for Windows compatibility
- âœ… Start script configured with HTTPS environment variables

## How to use:

### Start Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Access Your Application
- **URL**: https://localhost:3000
- **Certificate**: Trusted by your browser (no security warnings)

### Validate Setup
```bash
# Run validation script
.\validate-https.ps1
```

## Troubleshooting:

### If you get certificate errors:
1. Run `mkcert -install` to reinstall the CA
2. Restart your browser
3. Clear browser cache/cookies for localhost

### If npm start fails:
1. Check that certificates exist in `certs/` folder
2. Verify cross-env is installed: `npm list cross-env`
3. Run validation script: `.\validate-https.ps1`

## Technical Details:

### Environment Variables Used:
- `HTTPS=true` - Enables HTTPS in react-scripts
- `SSL_CRT_FILE=./certs/localhost.pem` - Certificate file path
- `SSL_KEY_FILE=./certs/localhost-key.pem` - Private key file path

### Cross-platform Compatibility:
- Uses `cross-env` for Windows/Linux/Mac compatibility
- Works with both CMD and PowerShell on Windows

## Security Notes:

- Certificates are only valid for development
- Local CA is only trusted on this machine
- Never commit certificates to version control (already in .gitignore)
