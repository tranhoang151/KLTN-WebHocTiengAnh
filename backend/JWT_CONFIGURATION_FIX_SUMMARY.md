# JWT Configuration Fix Summary

## Problem
When running the backend in Visual Studio, encountered the following error:
```
System.InvalidOperationException: JWT Secret not configured
```

## Root Cause
The JWT Secret was not properly configured in the application settings. The JwtAuthenticationMiddleware was looking for `JWT:Secret` configuration but it wasn't available in the loaded configuration files.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added JWT Configuration to appsettings.json
```json
{
  "JWT": {
    "Secret": "your-super-secret-jwt-key-that-should-be-at-least-32-characters-long",
    "Issuer": "BingGoWebAPI",
    "Audience": "BingGoWebAPI-Users",
    "ExpiryInMinutes": 60
  }
}
```

### 2. Added JWT Configuration to appsettings.Development.json
```json
{
  "JWT": {
    "Secret": "development-jwt-secret-key-for-local-testing-only-32-chars-minimum",
    "Issuer": "BingGoWebAPI-Dev",
    "Audience": "BingGoWebAPI-Dev-Users",
    "ExpiryInMinutes": 120
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated JwtAuthenticationMiddleware
Modified the JWT Secret reading logic to support both configuration paths:
```csharp
_jwtSecret = _configuration["Security:JWT:Secret"] ?? _configuration["JWT:Secret"] ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("JWT Secret not configured");
```

This allows the middleware to read from either:
- `Security:JWT:Secret` (from appsettings.Security.json)
- `JWT:Secret` (from appsettings.json or appsettings.Development.json)

### 4. Added appsettings.Security.json Loading to Program.cs
```csharp
// Add additional configuration files
builder.Configuration.AddJsonFile("appsettings.Security.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);
```

## Files Modified
1. `backend/appsettings.json` - Added JWT configuration
2. `backend/appsettings.Development.json` - Added JWT configuration for development
3. `backend/Middleware/JwtAuthenticationMiddleware.cs` - Updated JWT Secret reading logic
4. `backend/Program.cs` - Added appsettings.Security.json loading

## Result
- Backend now builds successfully with 0 errors
- JWT configuration is properly loaded from multiple sources
- Application can start without the "JWT Secret not configured" error
- Supports both development and production JWT configurations

## Security Notes
- The JWT secrets provided are examples and should be replaced with secure, randomly generated keys in production
- JWT secrets should be at least 256 bits (32 characters) long for security
- Consider using environment variables or Azure Key Vault for production secrets
